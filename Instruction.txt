In order to run the VirtualPetSimulator, you’ll need to have maven supported.
1. Open GameControl.java
2. Hit run and a window will pop up
3. Press start or exit game
4. If you choose to start, you can either create a pet or load a pet from your created database(The database will be empty until you’ve created a pet)
5. Once the pet has been loaded or created, you can interact with the pet object and it will start updating it's status
6. Interacting with the pet will either increase or decrease the pet’s status which you can see by clicking on the “check status”
7. You can only save your pet’s state if you let it sleep
8. Once you let it sleep, you can exit the pet window and it will bring you back to the start where you can repeat the process. 
   This time though, if you have created a pet, if you choose to load the pet you will see your pet in a list.
